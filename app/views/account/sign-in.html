      <p>You can search for a teacher’s record using their last name and date of birth.</p>
      <p>A teacher’s record includes their qualifications and also tells you if they:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>failed their induction or probation</li>
        <li>are prevented from teaching by a prohibition order</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills (QTLS) status</h2>

      <p>This service will not tell you if a teacher has QTLS. You need to check the <a href="https://set.et-foundation.co.uk/your-career/professional-status-register">Society for Education and Training professional register</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">School managers and governors</h2>

      <p>There's a separate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/individuals-prohibited-from-managing-or-governing-schools">list of people who are not allowed to manage or govern schools</a>. This is sometimes called the section 128 list.
